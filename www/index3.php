If you have questions on how to use these sections, please contact Kate so that she can help you through the process. <br /><br />In addition to the new section, there have been two additional attendance statuses created. One for a dress code violation and one for arriving to the event late. Please mark your attendance as usual on the attendance page and then visit the users' profiles with whom you need to mark for these special events. If you find an error, please let Kate know as well. <br/><br/>Your actions are recorded and abuse will be tracked.Thanks.</div>";
